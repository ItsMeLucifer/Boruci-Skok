# **Description**
*Boruci Skok* is a platform game in which the player's main task is to get to the top using only jumping.

## **Controls**
In terms of movement, the player can use three buttons during the game - left arrow, right arrow and space bar. Therefore, all movement in the game is done by jumping, the strength of which can be controlled by the time the space bar is pressed.

## **Gameplay**
### *Multiplayer*
In the above game I used [Photon](https://www.photonengine.com/pun) technology to support multiplayer. Unfortunately, due to certain restrictions, only 20 people at a time can play in *Boruci Skok*.
### *Singleplayer*
Despite the fact that the idea of the game was focused on team play, in *Boruci Skok* you can play in SinglePlayer mode - unfortunately due to some mechanics, some characters are not available in this mode.
### *Characters*
There are 7 characters available in *Boruci Skok*, 2 of which are unavailable in singleplayer mode.

It is possible to enable spectator mode in the game, thanks to which the player is able to watch his companions during the game. In addition, Spectate mode turns on automatically when you reach the end of the game.
